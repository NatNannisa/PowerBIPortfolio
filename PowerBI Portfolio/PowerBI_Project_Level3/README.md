# Level 3: Logistics and Inventory Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to track and optimize logistics and inventory KPIs across multiple warehouses and suppliers. This dashboard helps stakeholders monitor stock levels, delivery efficiency, and identify inventory bottlenecks.

- Data Modeling (Star Schema with role-playing dates)
- Advanced DAX: Inventory KPIs, USERELATIONSHIP, Time Intelligence
- Power BI visuals: Slicers, Drill-downs, KPI cards
- Real-world operational metrics and layout

## 📁 Data Sources
Mock data created using Excel and Mockaroo. Tables:
- Sales
