\## üîç Project Overview



This project simulates the role of a \*\*Business Intelligence Analyst\*\* for a retail chain. The goal is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides executives with \*\*sales insights\*\*, \*\*customer segmentation\*\*, and \*\*store performance\*\* analytics using multiple related data sources.



You‚Äôll find use of data modeling, DAX measures, calculated columns, and relationship management across multiple tables ‚Äî with realistic data generated using Python/Faker.

\## üìê Key DAX Measures



```DAX

Total Sales = SUM(Sales\[Sales\_Amount])

Total Profit = SUM(Sales\[Profit])

Avg Order Value = DIVIDE(\[Total Sales], DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales\[Order\_ID]))

Profit Margin = DIVIDE(\[Total Profit], \[Total Sales])

Return Rate = DIVIDE(COUNT(Returns\[Return\_ID]), DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales\[Order\_ID]))
